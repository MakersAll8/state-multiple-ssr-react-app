This project serves as a sandbox environment to experiment.

The `micro-frontends` architecture used in here is a bit unwieldy in comparison with using `module federation` introduced in `webpack 5`. However, `webpack 5` was not invented when this architecture was concocted.

Core concepts involved include `react`, `server side render` through `express`, `server side include` or `ssi` for short, and `reverse proxying` through `nginx`.
